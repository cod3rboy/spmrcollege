                        It becomes imperative for us, the upholders of the prestigious heritage, to make our students feel proud, by telling them that they are part of a strong linage of royalty and intellect. This will in place help them to develop together a history of their own for their future peers and friends.
                        <br>
                        <br> Dr. Karan Singh, the then visionary Sadar-e-Riyasat in 1955, in order to keep alive the memory of Late His Highness Maharaja Pratap Singh of Jammu and Kashmir State, founded the college and named it Sri Pratap Memorial Rajput College of Commerce.
                        <br>
                        <br> Dr. Karan Singh introduced the commerce stream for the first time in the State. Today, Govt. SPMR College is a prestigious name in the discipline of commerce.
                        <br>
                        <br> In the initial stage, during its infancy, the college was housed in the Ajaib Ghar building behind the New Secretariat and at later stage it was shifted to the then Police Complex near Jogi Gate,1962 to 1978. The State Government took over this college on September 30, 1974 and rechristened it as Govt. SPMR College of Commerce, Jammu. The college has been fortunate from its infancy right to this day to have been headed by an array of illustrious Principals for its all round development. The first Principal of this college was a renowned teacher, Professor M.L. Shandilya of Sri Ram College of Commerce, New Delhi. He was at the helm of affairs from June 1, 1955 to Feb. 2, 1959. Thereafter, Prof. G.P. Singh took hold of the reins of this college and made it a seat of genuine learning during its formative and developmental phase. Of late, this college has brought in changes to keep pace with the changing scenario in business studies and can boast, without exaggeration, to offer the best academic and vocational fields in the state.
                        <br>
                        <br> Govt. S.P.M.R College of Commerce, which is now affiliated to the University of Jammu, is proud of its alumni who are well known faces in the crowd by their sheer dedication and dint of hard work in their respective fields, thereby serving as a beacon light for the present generation of youth for whom this college offers a variety of career opportunities.
                        <br>
                        <br> The college is committed to prepare young managers for facing the inevitable challenge arising from the advent of privatization and global liberalization. It will push its infrastructure and academic development programme at a much greater speed to increase the capability and competence of the students so that they can face the ever developing fields of software technology and also build up skills to brave the constant prevalence of multinational companies in our country. The college will equip itself to support the students wanting to excel in their respective fields. In due course of time the college will fashion itself as a core, a centre of technological and Business Entrepreneurship.
